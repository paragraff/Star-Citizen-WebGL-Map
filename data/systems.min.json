        "article": "Greetings, traveler, there are millions of sights to see in the universe. The team at THE OBSERVIST is here to make sure you get the best traveling experience possible.\r\n\r\nThe system of Castra has been vital to the UEE, but not in many of the normal ways. When UPE military pathfinders discovered the system in 2544, they found a pair of planets circling a large blue-white star. It was described as ‘unremarkable’ in its initial assessment.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the UPE began to process the second planet to act as a training facility and back-up resource cache for Hadrian system, then the point system along what would become known as the Perry Line that borders the Xi’An Empire. To mirror these military designs for the planet, the system was called Castra, using the ancient Roman name for land designated specifically for military use.\r\n\r\n## CASTRA II\r\n\r\nWhen Castra II was finally terraformed, Ivar Messer had already ascended to the newly created position of Prime Citizen. He wasted no time allocating resources to build up Castra II as a source of reinforcements for the military at Hadrian as well as a staging area for an invasion into Xi’An territory, should the opportunity ever present itself.\r\n\r\nWhen the jump point to Oya system was discovered near the end of the 26th century, Castra ceased being a secondary base; it was now on the front line. Long-range bombers would circle the jump point toward Oya, waiting for a signal to push into Xi’An territory and blast their targets. When Castra’s jump to Tohil was discovered, it was another way into the UEE from Xi’An space. The Imperator whipped this fear of attack up to cut off civilian traffic into Castra entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen the Messers fell, military tensions turned to diplomatic relations. Tohil and Oya became part of the Empire when the Perry Line was divided into the Transitional Systems. Very quickly, the military on Castra discovered that they weren’t the front line anymore. In 2789, the military scaled back their presence to reopen the system for civilians, even repurposing most of the military structures for public use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## INTRODUCING SHERMAN\r\n\r\nBuilt atop Ulysses Peak, Sherman served as the primary launch point for the heavy bombers that would maintain a constant vigil near the jump points into Xi’An territory. A majority of the base has now been demilitarized for civilian use, transforming the Navy’s landing pads and mechanic bays into the primary landing zone for traffic entering and leaving the planet.\r\n\r\nDepending on the time of year, you may see what appears to be a landscape of clouds shrouding the surface of the planet. Poking up through that canopy will be Sherman, a virtual island in the sky.\r\n\r\nQuick note: you enthusiasts will also probably notice a lot of firepower on your approach: anti-ship batteries as well as a pair of AOV-9 anti-orbital cannons. They may look old, but don’t try to be funny. They still work.\r\n\r\nThe military sold off the landing zone. It changed hands several times over the years until it became a PARKING LOT franchise owned by REEZUS THORN, who also handles the site’s minimal ship repairs.\r\n\r\nAs one of Sherman’s new primary functions is a quick stopover point for travelers, they cluster a lot of their stores near the Parking Lot, allowing pilots to quickly hit up the local TDD office as well as familiar names like FUEL PUMP, HARDPOINT GUYS, APOCALYPSE ARMS and ELEMENT AUTHORITY and be on their way. But there’s a lot more to Sherman than that.\r\n\r\nWalking among the unmistakable Hennowistic military prefabs of the 27th century, you can’t help but feel a sense of history. Small reminders of the men and women who served here can be found throughout the zone, but none more prominent than in the EDGE OF OBLIVION. The Edge is a small pub filled with actual memorabilia from the era, offering patrons a brief glimpse into the daily lives of the bomber pilots who ran those dangerous missions.\r\n\r\nBefore you leave, you should go to the OUTLOOK. During the day, if the weather’s right, you will find a tumultuous sea of clouds stretching as far as the eye can see. At night, you can see the glow from distant cities seeping up through the clouds, creating diffused pools of light. It’s one of the most magnificent sights to behold on a planet whose history is steeped in fear and aggression. But don’t just take my word for it; it’s really something you need to observe for yourself.",

Centauri was one of the first systems settled during Humanity’s initial period of interstellar expansion. It was discovered in 2365 by a dedicated survey ship that immediately recognized the tremendous colonization potential of the third planet. The flag was quickly planted on Centauri III and land there was immediately offered at a premium to colonial outfitting groups. The result was Saisei, one of the most beautiful and well-constructed Human worlds in the UEE. In the development process, the other worlds in the system went largely ignored. In the ensuing centuries, scattered resources have been discovered on these other worlds and more scattershot development has taken place.\r\n\r\n### Inner Planets\r\n\r\nCentauri’s innermost world is a tiny protoplanet that orbits very close to the star. Centauri I has no atmosphere and no mineable resources. The close-up view of Centauri’s star from orbit, however, is overwhelming. A well-known photograph (commonly available as a post card) taken by the initial system survey ship shows the blue-white star with a prominence reaching out to seemingly grab the tiny planet.\r\n\r\nCentauri II, called Yar, was initially a Venusian world that has since been terraformed by the UEE. Its proximity to the sun makes for an arid environment, and the planet is largely covered by the Red Desert, decidedly its identifying feature from orbit. Yar is dotted with research stations, commercial layover points and abandoned settlements, many of which are coated in the planet’s fine red sand (and a significant number of which are being reclaimed entirely by the Red Desert). Although it’s not quite a ghost planet, many visitors report being left with a sense of unease among its abandoned facilities.\r\n\r\nWhy is there development in the first place? Yar underwent an unexpected land grab roughly a century ago after valuable precious minerals were located in a mountain range. These claims petered out quickly, and Human civilization on the planet has been in a clear decline since. The world’s largest landing pad is Archibald Station, a scientific outpost that grew into a small town and then shrank back to an outpost as interest in the planet waned. Other landing zones on the planet continue to remain functional, although unmaintained. Enough infrastructure remains on the planet to support passing spacecraft, although the small population needs only essentials from traders.\r\n\r\n### Saisei\r\n\r\nSaisei, the third planet, is the reason to visit Centauri. A beautifully terraformed world, Saisei has been planned nd cultivated for Human habitation since the initial survey. Saisei is one of the only worlds in explored space where the Governor’s Council has imposed a population cap, limiting the number of inhabitants to preserve the environment. Despite their similarly limited populations, Saisei stands in sharp contrast to Yar as a jewel of Human development.\r\n\r\nCentauri was first surveyed in 2365 and bids for Centauri III went on the market almost immediately. The winning group, ADJUST Colonial, consisted largely of Earthen Japanese expatriates who carried over design foundations and other cultural memes from their homeland to the landfall location at Fujin City. Saisei’s own culture has veered in unique directions since this time, influenced by earthly tradition but having become something completely unique. In addition to natural beauty, organic construction and a limited population, Centauri is also known as the headquarters of MISC, the ship concern responsible for much of the UEE’s heavy vehicle traffic.\r\n\r\nFujin City is the landing point for most visitors to Saisei. It boasts a fully automated high volume landing zone, Saisei Landing Consortium. Personal hangars here are few and far between, with real estate everywhere on the world going for high UEC values. The city features all the comforts of home, from an Astro-Armada ship dealer to an Advocacy Field office. Downtown Fujin is home to the MISC corporate showroom, where visitors can see the latest Freelancer, Starfarer and bulk transport hulls on display. At the heart of the city is Nessa Park, a beautifully cultivated park designed as an oasis for city workers involved in high tech industries all day.\r\n\r\nThe central MISC factory is located in the city’s outer environs, a carefully crafted automated setup that has been duplicated on many other worlds. The majority of MISC Starfarers are currently constructed in this facility and then shipped off-world on massive enclosed ship transports (though the fully modular factory can change ship output types overnight). A great deal of other heavy industry takes place on Saisei, but always planned in an environmentally respectful manner. The result is a massive export of ship components, luxury items and other heavy industry that would seem to be completely at odds with Saisei’s well-deserved reputation as the cleanest planet in the known galaxy. The message to other Human worlds is clear: planning pays off!\r\n\r\n### Outer Planets\r\n\r\nCentauri IV is a rocky world with one interesting feature: it completely lacks a molten core. As a coreless world, the planet never developed an electromagnetic field and was never able to retain a serious atmosphere (archaeological studies have revealed that it had a limited atmosphere for some time, but that solar wind impacts ultimately fully eliminated it roughly three thousand years ago). Due to its proximity to the system’s asteroid belt, Centauri IV has been heavily impacted by asteroidal strikes. The world is considered a potential candidate for terraforming, albeit a very poor one: the need for special technology and resources to construct a core would be an incredibly expensive and technically difficult proposition.\r\n\r\nBeyond Centauri IV lies a dense asteroid belt, the only one in the system. Although the Centauri Belt contains enough mass to form a planet, for whatever reason it has never come together. The region is rich in standard heavy metals, and pop-up mining bases frequently appear to support Saisei’s heavy industry. The system’s outermost planet, Centauri V, is a massive Super Jupiter, a red and yellow gas giant several times the size of those normally encountered. The world’s atmosphere makes an excellent stop-over for long-haul transports seeking fuel, but it has not been otherwise developed.",

Located near the Banu Protectorate, the city sees thousands of ships pass in and around its atmosphere on any given day. As commerce was woven into the fabric of the town, the traffic lanes that demarcate ascent and descent paths into the port have been in place since the town’s founding. Historically, there had never been a serious problem.\r\n\r\nThey can no longer make such a claim.\r\n\r\nShortly before sunrise, the residents of New Junction were ripped from their slumber by a rain of fire and debris when a pair of transport ships collided and crashed to the surface below. While local planning boards and Imperial zoning officials carefully position traffic lanes away from residential areas to minimize potential damage should a tragedy such as this occur, this incident highlighted a possible oversight in their planning.\r\n\r\nGhara Halloway, the early morning attendant at the local TDD, witnessed the whole thing.\r\n\r\n“I figured they’d seen each other, you know?” She recounted, still trembling. “There was that moment when I realized that, for whatever reason, they hadn’t seen each other, I felt this pit in my stomach. I didn’t even know what to do.”\r\n\r\nAs Vesta, a Retaliator-class ship retrofitted for cargo transport, was ascending off the surface, the pilot, identified from landing logs as Errol Daniels of Croshaw, realized that he was about to collide with an inbound Freelancer, still unidentified as of press time. He executed evasive maneuvers. Unfortunately the Freelancer attempted the same. Their attempts to evade took them both out of the traffic lane where they collided. Their trajectory sent them toward the F-Block just south of downtown New Junction, where they crashed into the Walden Towers housing development.\r\n\r\nFirst responders quickly descended on the crash site to find the structures engulfed in flames. Residents had already begun flooding out of the towers, many covered in soot and ash. As fire technicians went into the building, they were joined by other locals who raced from the surrounding residences to aid in the evacuation.\r\n\r\n“What happened today was awful. One of the worst days I’ve seen in my thirty-four years,” said Dan Corvi, a lieutenant of the NJFD. “But, it was incredible to see a community pull together to help avert further loss of life.”\r\n\r\nThe fires burned for over three hours, severely damaging the central support system of the Walden. Rescue efforts on the higher floors had to be called off until the fire could be brought under control. Remote scanners had to be deployed to continue the search for survivors.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from the Governors Council arrived to oversee the rescue efforts.\r\n\r\n“Of course we are totally committed to offering any support and assistance we can,” Dexter Fowley of the New Junction Governors Council declared in an impromptu press conference. “I’ve already received word from Bresson and even Tanis that they will send whatever help is available to help the families, so I’d like to thank them.”\r\n\r\nFowley went on to address the greater concern.\r\n\r\n“It seems that the horrible events of today have exposed a lack of protocol that needs to be addressed. Quite simply, a system for all pilots, both commercial and non, to address flight protocol within traffic lanes and a standardized form of emergency evasion techniques. After I’m no longer needed here, I plan to gather the other Governors and send a message to the Senate asking for the necessary means to devise such a system. We have been content with our system in the past; today has shown us that we need to demand more, so these lives will not have been lost in vain.”",

The team at THE OBSERVIST is here to make sure that you get the best traveling experience possible.\r\n\r\nCroshaw system was our doorway to the stars. Its discovery completely changed the course of Human development. That’s why the system bears the name of the man who discovered it. When we arrived, this was the first planet we claimed:\r\n\r\n##ANGELI\r\n\r\nOver the years, many historians have debated that we might not have been so eager to populate Angeli if we had known that the planet suffered from volatile bouts of tectonic activity. Geologists have been predicting a massive quake for decades now. As of yet, it hasn’t come.\r\n\r\nRegardless, Angeli has grown to one of the more populated planets in the UEE, generations upon generations of families living and growing here.\r\n\r\n###INTRODUCING QUINTON\r\n\r\nFounded in 2286, the city of Quinton is located along the equator, anchored by a beautiful oasis nestled between a small range of mountains and the coast. The skyline is one of the most iconic in Human experience, rivaling those of Earth and even Terra. Due to the planet’s tumultuous geological activity, all of the buildings here must adhere to strict engineering codes to protect against the earthquakes, but they utilize a variety of techniques to achieve it. The most common is the use of tuned mass dampers in the taller skyscrapers, massive pendulums incorporated into the building to offset movement allowing the structure to withstand high winds and the shifting land mass.\r\n\r\nSo what should you know heading into Quinton? Well, Randal Hope’s classic 24th century song painted a very specific picture: “I came to Quinton and tried to forget, but there you were in the sad and lonely.” Residents disliked being associated with the mournful ballad; to them Quinton was a place to start over. It was a fresh world for those frustrated with life on Earth.\r\n\r\nThese days, Quinton is commonly associated with the same traditional vein as Earth. It is a heavy commercial traffic zone, home to many companies that wanted proximity to Earth but without the exorbitant real estate prices.\r\n\r\nIt is this commercial angle that will greet you when you set down on the R&H landing pad. Immediately you will find connecting halls to the Trade & Development Division that handles all incoming and outgoing commercial shipping. Job ops aside, the real gem here is Tessa Weiss, the most welcoming and accommodating person to ever work a TDD counter — so much so that the haulers who frequent Croshaw have nicknamed her “Mom.”\r\n\r\nThere’s a market nearby with many of your favorite stores: Cry-Astro, Hardpoint Guys, and Apocalypse Arms to name a few. Here you will also find a statue of the man himself, Nick Croshaw, proudly standing in the center of the market for all travelers to revere.\r\n\r\nThe Governors Council has their offices in Quinton to satisfy any civic needs you may have.\r\n\r\nGrab a drink at Tug’s Court, a bar near the water that bears a mystery for the ages. Opened in 2910, the name of the small drinking establishment is allegedly a literary reference but, to date, no one has ever figured out where it came from. The mystery will most likely continue on as the original owner, Marian Tessle, died in 2935. It hasn’t stopped customers from trying to guess.\r\n\r\nThe new owner, Renly Sig, has monthly contests where the patrons can present their theories on the origin. Renly claims that Marian did not disclose the answer to him.\r\n\r\nOne word of warning to our readers who may live on the more … questionable … side of the law. You might want to avoid Tug’s entirely, or if not, at least avoid mentioning your activities too loudly, as Renly earned the money to buy the bar by hunting pirates. He has openly stated that he might come out of retirement if “the right scumbag walks into my joint.”\r\n\r\nHopefully, you won’t require the Quinton Medical Center after your visit to Tug’s, but it’s there if you need it.\r\n\r\nThe city of Quinton has one more part in Human history. The writer Binh Osgoode moved to the city shortly after the terraforming was complete. During the groundbreaking ceremony for Quinton, he was quoted as saying:\r\n\r\n“I honestly can’t believe I will say this without fiction or imagination: I live on a planet in an alien system.”\r\n\r\nWhile that seems quaint now, it’s still pretty cool.\r\n\r\nRemember, it’s great to hear us talk about it, but you really got to observe it for yourself.",

        "article": "##Galactic Guide: Davien\r\n\r\n![Davien concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/cbxwaiy4q43m9r/post/Jata__2__thumb.jpg)\r\n\r\nDavien is best known as the site of first contact between Humans and the Banu. Discovered early in mankind’s extrasolar expansion, Davien was charted by Wendell Dopse and named after his father-in-law. The most unusual facet of Davien’s discovery was what it represented to the broader astrophysics community: contemporary science had predicted that no additional jump points would exist in the Croshaw system. When Dopse charted the jump to Davien, it meant that textbooks had to be rewritten and it ultimately lead to a flurry of advancements in jump scanning technology.\r\n\r\nDavien itself was not seen as so interesting. A slight, orange Type K Main Sequence Star, Davien was immediately considered nothing to write home about by its original explorers. Four planets orbited the star, the second of which was a candidate (albeit not a top list candidate) for terraforming. The system held no exotic resource caches or strategic military chokeholds; it seemed destined to become a lightly-populated backwater star system adjacent to more developed areas of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThat all changed quickly in 2438. Vernon Tar, an independent navjumper, opened fire on what he believed to be another private spacecraft attempting to jump his meager claim in the system. The ship in question turned out to be a Banu merchantman and the unfortunate incident (which luckily did not lead to loss of life) became humanity’s first introduction to the Banu Protectorate. The UPE quickly established a military-led watch station in the system to take control of the situation, and the first interstellar treaty with the Protectorate slowly took shape. (The ultimate irony for all parties involved, not discovered for many years, was that Davien was not especially close to the Banu coreworlds; the ship originally engaged by Tar was a fugitive fleeing civilization.)\r\n\r\nThe result for the Davien system was electrifying. Every independent operator in the galaxy wanted real estate in the system, now set to become the jumping off point to trade with the Banu. With the potential for exotic materials, alien technology and more, the system was flooded with all forms of humanity, and Davien II developed into one of the more populated Human worlds in the galaxy. BabCo GeoBuilders, which had won a low-ball terraforming bid before first contact, was propelled up the stock market as the demand for hangars, habicubes and underground domes soared.\r\n\r\n###Davien I\r\n\r\nA large, battered and gray rock that is visually similar to Earth’s moon, Davien I makes a reasonable poster child for the concept of a useless world. Coreless and without any interesting minerals, there is absolutely no reason to set foot on the planet. In fact, there have been no recorded landings on Davien I since the initial system exploration mission determined that it could never be a candidate for terraforming.\r\n\r\n###Davien II (Cestulus)\r\n\r\nDavien II, named Cestulus after terraforming was completed in the early 26th century, is the system’s inhabitable world. Cestulus has a very thin atmosphere and the majority of Human habitation is beneath its rocky surface: elaborate biodomes pump air from above ground into habicubes constructed to stack miles beneath the planet’s crust. The world has no particularly interesting resources and the bulk of its economy is associated with transport and shipping. Despite the distance from the Banu, the infrastructure that has sprang up on Davien has allowed it to become the so-called “gateway to the Eastern Empire.” Dozens of major cargo runs criss-cross the system, and the planet is dotted in spaceports with facilities to entertain and supply long-haul transport crews.\r\n\r\nJata is Cestulus’ most emblematic city, though not technically the world’s capital. Located underneath an everexpanding warren of air production facilities, the city is most famously home to Aegis Dynamics’ corporate headquarters and initial production facilities. The base primarily produces components rather than a particular ship design. More exotic resources are imported and the need is consistent. Beyond Aegis’ footprint in the city, the unique ‘open air’ underground cityscape has become symbolic of the Davien system as a whole.\r\n\r\nFor reasons not completely understood by sociologists, Cestulus became a flashpoint for political upheaval. In 2529, the feared economic collapse that accompanied the introduction of the Empire’s unified currency, UEC, lead to a bloody, two-week riot in the city of Jata. Only military intervention stopped the protest. In 2545 the planet was the site of terrorist bombings that left thousands dead, with bombs being planted specifically to collapse some of the planet’s more populated overground biodomes. These strikes kicked off a series of similar (and still unattributed) attacks across the UPE that lead to the adoption of Ivar Messer’s Prime Citizen plan. In recent years, Cestulus has become the adopted podium of everyone from Terran secessionists to anti-alien xenophobia groups.\r\n\r\nTravelers are well-warned that owing to the system’s history of political upheaval, the Advocacy forces and local militia units in Davien are no-nonsense elites. Your cargo will be scanned when you enter the system, land, take off and exit. Waystations and well-equipped militia spacecraft are the rule here, and only the most advanced artificial holds and scanner blankets can possibly move contraband through Davien’s “galactic truckstop.” There is no humor for smugglers, even the most harmless varieties.\r\n\r\n###Davien III\r\n\r\nDavien III is a smog planet with an acid-based atmosphere. With no apparent resources worth the risk of establishing a protective enclosure colony, the planet remains uninhabited. Rumors do persist that Davien III is a dumping ground for troublemakers and others who find themselves on the wrong side of the region’s organized criminal syndicates. The planet’s pools of acid will quickly render any body (or spacecraft or most anything else) unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n###Davien IV\r\n\r\nDavien IV is a beautiful but inhospitable ice giant. Owing to its orbit’s proximity to the system’s jump point out to Cathcart (the jump point used by that first Banu) and its very stable orbit, the 25th-century UPE military mission was established in Davien IV’s orbit. Today, the base is the Banu Friendship Museum, where visitors can learn an overly-simplified story of mankind’s interactions with the Protectorate. Few tourists are interested enough to make the trek to the system’s outer reaches, however, and the museum is constantly in danger of losing its funding.",

Home of the Murray Cup, the most famous racing event in the galaxy, Ellis is a star system that plays off its reputation to any tourists or other visitors who pass within a light-year of the outer worlds. Despite this, Ellis is actually a very interesting star system on its own merits: from hordes of indigenous life forms that are unlike anything present anywhere else in known space, to an economy based on something other than ship part construction, to the sheer number and variety of planets present in the system, Ellis is worth at least one voyage.\r\n\r\nCosmologically, Ellis is an F3V Yellow star with an especially thick green band, allowing an unusually high amount of human habitation. The system is located in a highly developed region of UEE space with strong jump ties to Nexus and Kilian. Politically, it is a corporate owned star system, although this is more trivia than an actual issue of governance. Despite its association with space racing, Ellis has never been a manufacturing powerhouse; instead, it exports unrefined minerals and seafood to other populated systems in the local star cluster.\r\n\r\n### Inner Planets\r\n\r\nEllis I and II are typical inner-system uninhabitable worlds. Ellis I is a protoplanet that orbits so close to the star that it is frequently caught within solar flares. Miners consider Ellis I the ultimate tease: advanced scanners have revealed that the bubbling magma surface hides a fortune in rare minerals … but there is no shielding technology yet available that would allow a mining crew to access them. Dozens of pilots and crews have been killed in the attempt. Ellis II is shrouded in a thick, smoggy atmosphere. The surface is barren and otherwise uninteresting, although the constant severe storms are an attractive diversion for observers.\r\n\r\n### Inhabitable Band: Green, Kampos & Noble\r\n\r\nGreen, Ellis’ third planet, is the most recent to be terraformed. Located on the edge of the system’s inhabitable green zone (hence the imaginative name), the world was purpose-constructed as a resort world to cater to visitors interested in the Murray Cup. A terraformed ocean world, the planet is dotted with luxury towers and mega-resorts. To preserve the world’s elaborate underwater reefs, only a single landing zone is allowed, in the coastal city of Aydo. Due to the fact that Green was terraformed, it has no native sea life. Attempts to transport species from Kampos and Earth have met with abject failure.\r\n\r\nEllis IV was the first world settled in the system and it remains the most populated planet. It is also the only planet in the Ellis System with an economy that revolves around anything but racing. Kampos is a high-gravity ocean world stocked with all manner of sealife. The planet itself is named after a particularly large sea creature (though not one of the many whose harvested meat is available for export). Kampos’ high gravity also gave rise to the evolution of flatcats, which formed the basis of a brief fad in the UEE core worlds. The world is frequently called Seahorse by the locals, so-named for the appearance of some of the high-gravity sea monsters harvested by native fishermen.\r\n\r\nThe third of Ellis’ populated planets, Noble (Ellis V) is a mid-sized forest world. The planet is largely unremarkable, with corporate dictates requiring that most of the surface be preserved as-is. A single spaceport near the south polar region allows visitors to explore a beautiful landscape reminiscent of an undeveloped Earth. Two moons make for an especially beautiful landscape at night, although there is a consistent fear that urban development will spread on the world to support the ever increasing number of race fans traveling to the system.\r\n\r\n### Undeveloped Worlds\r\n\r\nEllis VI sits just outside the green band, a rocky terrestrial world that is currently being used by the UEE for research into human habitation. The hope is that terraforming techniques will expand to the point that planets farther and farther from a star will be able to someday support a human biosphere. A small science station is in geostationary orbit for this purpose and the population of scientists are always eager to purchase luxury goods to while away the time spent at their thankless tasks. Ellis VII and VIII are similarly uninhabitable worlds. VII features a highly corrosive atmosphere that can be damaging to ships entering local orbit. Ellis VIII is the smallest full world in the system, an uninteresting rock with a limited atmosphere.\r\n\r\n## Gas Giants\r\n\r\nThe Ellis system features two gas giants: Ellis IX, aka Walleye, and Ellis X. Walleye is the largest of the two and has been completely commercialized as a fueling world. While Walleye is most famously recognized as a pit stop for racers, most of the time it is the site of impressive queues of freighters and warships waiting to take on fuel. Long-haul transports making the Earth-Pinecone run frequently begin at Walleye, and a variety of ‘rest stop’ facilities have grown up in orbit. Ellis X, Bombora, is a smaller gas giant with an extremely turbulent atmosphere. Scooping fuel can be extremely dangerous, and pilots are advised to avoid any such attempt. On the other hand, it is a chance to skip the wait at Walleye and refuel your ship at no cost!\r\n\r\n### Outer Planets\r\n\r\nThe eleventh planet in the Ellis system was famously destroyed recently in a collision with its moon. The world was uninhabitable and astrophysicists had long been charging its apparent demise. Nevertheless, the impact resulted in an extremely dense debris field which pilots are advised to avoid at all costs. Outlying regions are a reasonable source for minerals, though, with gravity having already begun the refining process! Ellis XII, named Judecca, is a small frozen ball in space, the site of the occasional ice-mining expedition and little else. The outermost planet in the system, Ellis XIII, is known locally as Pinecone due to its strange shattered rock surface. Pinecone is rich in heavy minerals and is a popular destination for long-haul miners, many of whom transport ores all the way back to Earth itself for resale.\r\n\r\n\r\n> DEATH OF A PLANET [(source)](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/spectrum-dispatch/13049-News-Update-Death-Of-A-Planet)\r\n\r\n> by Martin Betemit\r\n\r\n> Staff Writer  \r\n\r\n> There are moments that remind Humanity how extraordinary our journey into the stars has been. Despite the horrible blunders we’ve committed as a species, it is worth celebrating the soaring achievements and truly mind-boggling events we’ve come to witness.\r\n\r\n> For years, the scientific community has been mesmerized by what amounts to a ballet on a cosmic scale, after a celestial collision between a wandering asteroid and Ellis XI’s small moon began that satellite’s slow, certain plunge towards the planet’s surface. Some scientists did gather early on in enthusiastic, but inevitably fruitless, brainstorms on how to deflect the asteroid or, later, return the moon to its natural orbit. In the end, the planet’s lack of perceived value and the exorbitant costs of the proposed schemes led them to admit failure.\r\n\r\n> From then on, the scientific community’s efforts became two-pronged: half watching and studying the slow death of moon and planet like children awaiting Christmas, and the remainder performing the reams of calculations required to anticipate all of the effects – and to minimize the collateral damage. Since then, there has been a non-stop flurry of activity in almost every bureau of the UEE.\r\n\r\n> At the eye of the hurricane, Senator Clay Harren distinguished himself by spearheading the government’s response, coordinating with the High Command to implement the safety protocols to protect Ellis’s inhabited planets from the potential debris, as well as folded in mining and scientific contracts to help offset clean-up costs.\r\n\r\n> Plans were enacted. Contracts were signed. Even Xi’An scientific committees appeared to watch this cosmic event unfold. All that was left was to wait. And wait the universe did.\r\n\r\n> Finally, it happened. 6.6.2943:03:11 SET, the moon impacted the surface of Ellis XI. The silent explosion of celestial objects was beyond description. Due to the minimum distance parameters given to the media, the scene initially felt like another of the simulated images that have been saturating the Spectrum for nearly two years. It took a few moments to realize that it was real, that this scene of cosmic destruction unfolding was indeed happening.\r\n\r\n> The moon struck Ellis XI at sixteen degrees above the equator. Some analysts estimated that over ten billion megatons of energy were released during the impact – 100 times the estimated impact of the Chicxulub asteroid on Earth in prehistoric times. The size of the impact actually moved Ellis XI a fraction of a degree out of its orbit, even while the massive tectonic activity from the collision began to tear the planet apart. The planet’s final act will be to leave a new asteroid belt as the epitaph to its epic demise.\r\n\r\n> In the aftermath of the collision, the military began to escort scientific crews into the wake of the destruction. Fortunately, Ellis X, the planet’s closest astronomical neighbor, was on the other side of the system at the time of the collision, and Ellis XII’s orbit is much more distant, so there is no significant perceived risk to either of its planetary siblings.\r\n\r\n> As the scientists now begin to study the inner workings of planets on an unprecedented scale, what does this event mean for the rest of the UEE? As far as a death of a planet goes, one couldn’t ask for a better candidate. Since Ellis XI was not an inhabited planet, there are no settlers to be relocated. The planet held little interest for mining or scientific communities. At best, Ellis System will simply require a few months of travel warnings and an update to the System Almanac and Galactic Guide to excise the deceased world and add a new asteroid belt.\r\n\r\n> Although that’s not entirely true. Outside of the science and mining community, the destruction of Ellis XI holds significant value to another organization: the Murray Cup Racing League.  The MCRL has set up the Ellis System as their homebase of astro-racing and is in the process of updating their rules to accommodate for the new obstacle course in their system.\r\n\r\n> So the moment has passed. The months and months of planning and anticipation have turned what many considered to be the penultimate form of destruction into a wealth of scientific research and mineral resources.\r\n\r\n> Yes, Humanity was allowed to bear witness to the passing of a planet. That, in and of itself, is remarkable, but more so, we were in a position to learn from it which, in the opinion of this reporter, is an even greater achievement.\r\n \r\n> . . . END TRANSCRIPT",

        "article": "Greetings, traveler, there are millions of sights to see in the universe. The team at THE OBSERVIST is here to make sure you get the best traveling experience possible.\r\n\r\nThe system of Elysium has a unique distinction in Human history; it was the flash point of our first interstellar war and site of the end of the second. Can’t say that about many places, can you? We’ll spare you the details because when you come here you want insight, not a boring history lesson. We’ll save that for the stiffs over at the Galactic Guide. Long story short, what the Tevarin once called Kaleeth became Elysium IV after the First Tevarin War. After the Second, Elysium IV was recognized by the Senate and became:\r\n\r\n## JALAN\r\n\r\nKnown for its vast fields of stunning and bizarre rock formations, Jalan still maintains some of the oldest Tevarin structures that managed to survive both wars and the Purge.\r\n\r\n### INTRODUCING GEMMA\r\n\r\nPerched atop a majestic mountaintop, the city now known as Gemma was formerly the site of a Tevarin stronghold. Extractions from surviving Codices suggest that the locale was not chosen for the view; rather it was perfectly suited to withstand siege and repel attackers. As the Tevarin civilization evolved, it became a perfect summation of their culture (beauty, precision and danger). Over the years, the UEE has tried to maintain as much of the Tevarin architecture as possible, but the elevation and increased air traffic have unfortunately begun to erode the buildings. Those structures that can’t be saved have been converted into decidedly Human architecture.\r\n\r\nLanding in Gemma will appear different, as the landing facility has been built to mimic Tevarin architecture, but should be familiar in the logistics. Platinum Bay has maintained the landing zone here for many years, and it still offers the amenities you’ve come to know and expect with a Fuel Pump and the local office of the TDD.\r\n\r\nMoving into the city proper takes you past some familiar stores, but be sure to check out the Vadili Market, an open-air arcade that’s been in operation (in one form or another) for over a thousand years. On most days, you can find San Pisoq, a Tevarin and local fixture of the market, who will be more than happy to fill you in on a bit of the history.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can find the Governor’s Council and a local Advocacy Office if you have Imperial business to handle, but skip all that and head down to Cedar Board, a local watering hole owned by the Roarke family that’s been in operation for almost sixty years. You can trace the family’s vast and fascinating military history all the way back to the old wars of Earth through the various pictures and relics proudly displayed on the walls of this quiet bar.\r\n\r\nHad the Humans not occupied Gemma during the Purge, the last (and probably most important) stop on our tour would have surely been lost. Here you will find one of the last known Temples of Rijora, and certainly none of the others are left in as good a condition as this one. Its architecture is so stunning in its elegance that even the Messers opted to preserve it. Maybe they were fans of architecture? Or maybe it was a begrudging respect for the enemy that catapulted Ivar Messer to power? Who knows, but it might be the only good thing that wretched family ever did. Moving into the massive structure, many are struck by the simplicity that awaits them inside. Rijoran doctrine emphasized active rather than passive existence, so you will find no chairs or pews, just large open spaces that were used by the Tevarin to develop their mental and physical abilities for warfare.\r\n\r\nWe can try to describe, but the only way to truly experience it is to observe it for yourself.",

Home to Hyperion, a dusty outpost planet, Fora has evolved into a safe zone in an area of space littered with Outsiders and Banu. Pirates, smugglers and worse frequently call the place their home and are largely ignored by the local police garrison.\r\n\r\nTerraforming problems left the world awash in perpetual HyperClay dust storms. The stuff coats nearly every surface and has such a low silica content as to be useless for mining purposes. Hyperion has a single landing area, Shoel, and no practical exports. If you’re on the run, though, it’s a good place to hide – bounties rarely reach this area of space.\r\n\r\nOther worlds in the system are completely dead, although they make a good hiding place for larger spacecraft. Fora does have one additional point of interest: it is probably the safest area to cross into Banu space undetected. As a result, you are likely to encounter plenty of smugglers in the system’s environs… as well as the occasional UEE special operations team.",

It’s a brand new day indeed.  Even at this NewsOrg, long an unofficial mouthpiece of the Imperator, we are finally able and encouraged to write the truth, without UEE censors looking over our shoulders.\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to believe, looking back, that the incident on Garron II would be the powder keg that brought it all down.  Sure this wasn’t a singular catalyst; there were incidents that built up to it.  From the bravery of Senator Akari to the Activists who rallied all those years despite incarceration or death.\r\n\r\nAside from instituting term limits for the Imperator, Toi worked with newly elected Senators to restore the Tribunal positions of old.  The new High-General, High-Secretary, and High Advocate will work under the Imperator position but with the power to disempower them, should another despot attempt to seize control.\r\n\r\nWe woke up.  Though the day we’re facing is unknown, we have seen how far we can fall so we must make sure that every step we take is a step up.",

Located at the forefront of a massive emission nebula, The Olympus Pool, this binary star system is so stunningly different from anything else in space that early explorers could not believe what they had happened across. Massive, permanent bands of turquoise, gold and deep orange expand infinitely across the sky in brilliant patterns from any viewpoint in the system. A persistent, unverifiable rumor claims that the system’s name derives from the first explorer captain’s reaction to his discovery: “Gosh.” Erstwhile travelers should be warned: do not repeat this anecdote in the presence of Gossians; they consider it the ultimate insult to their home and more than enough reason to start a fistfight.\r\n\r\n![Goss concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/mcsz6liqaumtrr/post/GossII_Cassel_Approach_02.jpg)\r\n\r\nLike the Grand Canyon on Earth or the Magnetic Ridge on Terra, Goss exists first and foremost as a tourist destination, with little to offer those not interested in taking in the sights. Goss was initially settled by a plethora of naturalistic religious groups, likely motivated by the belief that the system’s majestic nebulascape would allow them to better commune with their deities. As a result, the population today prides itself on its self-sufficiency, producing their own goods with little excess. The end result is that Goss is no place for a bulk trader.\r\n\r\nSmall-haulers are another story. Between hand-made Gossian goods, mountains of assorted tourist knickknacks and the rare life forms native to the system’s in- habitable worlds, there are plenty of high-demand goods available in small numbers. It’s a great way for an Aurora or a 300i pilot with a smaller cargo hold to supplement their vacation. Or, in the case of the more restricted life forms, a way for a pilot living outside the law to make quite a bit of profit.\r\n\r\nThe UEE military also regularly utilizes Goss as a port of call for shore leave for their longer-duration frontier-facing fleets. Civilians would do well to avoid the nightclubs and other hotspots on Cassel when a UEE carrier group is in orbit! The servicemen visiting the planet in such instances have usually been in space for eight to twelve months without relief, and enter the atmosphere looking for a good time. Local authorities are used to these visits and generally look the other way to much of the rowdiness. There is also a large military hospital complex on Goss III, the ultimate destination for warriors wounded in battle with the Vanduul.\r\n\r\n## Goss I (Unrecognized)\r\n\r\nThe innermost planet in Goss is an abundant world, considered the system’s breadbasket. From mineral-rich mountain ranges to endless fields for farming, Goss I produces 98% of the resources required to sustain both the system’s natives and the tourists who frequent the system. There is no room for out-system trade, though: almost everything produced on Goss I is shipped to the other two worlds in the system (extremely short-haul pilots are sometimes in demand for these runs, although it is dull work that produces a very small paycheck!) All of the property on Goss I is owned by natives and the world’s laws are incredibly strict about blocking outsiders (and corporations, specifically) from ever gaining a foothold.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other successful biospheres, Goss I has almost no ocean. The single largest body of water, roughly the size of Earth’s Mediterranean Sea, is filled with stagnant water that is almost entirely void of life (a species of moss-covered quasi-shrimp is the lone exception). Attempts to introduce some of the varied life forms from Cassel or elsewhere in the Empire have resulted in abject failure; for reasons yet to be determined, aquatic life can not adapt here.\r\n\r\n## Goss II: Cassel\r\n\r\n![Goss II Cassell Bar](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/pe9emuqdxyzrtr/post/GossII_Cassell_Bar_01.jpg)\r\n\r\nCassel (Cas-séll, never “Castle”; a common mispronunciation that also irritates the natives) is the resort world of the Goss System, the ultimate destination of hundreds of millions of Human tourists every year. As opposed to Goss I, Cassel is a beautiful ocean world. 85% of the world consists of vibrant, life-filled oceans and most of the rest is home to tropical rainforests.\r\n\r\nCities on Cassel have formed around the original landing arcologies established by Gossian colonists hundreds of years prior. Massive resort towns have also sprung up along the thousands of miles of beautiful coastlines. These are the ultimate destination of tourists. Whether you are here to view the Olympus Pool reflected on the pristine oceans or to frequent the planet’s infamous nightclubs, there is something for everyone on Cassel.\r\n\r\nCassel is home to one of the most complex aquatic ecospheres in the explored galaxy. With hundreds of thousands of complex species identified and many more lurking in the depths, Cassel’s seas are a sight to behold.\r\n\r\nIt is most famously home to the Midas fish, a naturally golden animal which has become symbolic of its home world and prized in fish tanks throughout the galaxy. Other native creatures include the eerie lang crab and the mammalian z-whale. Licenses to ship live animals are few and far between; there is a teeming black market for anyone willing to ship expensive fish off-world.\r\n\r\n## Goss III (Unrecognized)\r\n\r\nGoss III, a small sub-tropical world, is the acknowledged property of the UEE. The planet is largely undeveloped, although it is home to a mid-sized naval refitting base and the aforementioned hospital complex. Goss III is generally closed to visitors, although anyone who has business with the military facilities established there can acquire a landing pass with relative ease.\r\nThe Pool\r\n\r\nThe dark side of the Goss System is that the system’s nebula also acts as an effective curtain for nearby pirate operations. Pirate organizations have been known to base themselves in the outer gasses of the Olympus Pool and raid shipping or conduct illegal trade. It is believed that at least one standing pirate facility exists within the Pool, as well as standard rendezvous coordinates for several narcotics runs. Tourists should avoid this region of space entirely. Its denizens are especially brazen, given the frequency of UEE shore leave visits to Goss, although some theorize that the UEE actually encourages piracy in the region as it gives newly trained pilots a ready source of target practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n> **WARNING:** gravity effects of the binary star have rendered portions of the system untenable to starships not carrying Level 7 shields or above.

        "article": "## News Update: This Day in History\r\n\r\n###The Battle of Idris IV\r\n\r\n####October 1, 2544 SET\r\n\r\n####THE BATTLE THAT CHANGED HUMANITY\r\n\r\nThe Tevarin War had raged into its second year. Although the United Planets of Earth had managed to claim some decisive victories, the Tevarin were unrelenting, gaining ground in Centauri System and pushing UPE forces as far back as Ferron System.\r\n\r\nBy late August 2544 SET, High General Trevor Borland had grown impatient. In a strategy meeting with his advisers, he expressed a fear that by letting the battle lines equalize, he could see both sides becoming complacent and settling into a war of attrition. He wanted “to unbalance the Tevarin; to challenge their expectations of how we had been engaging them in warfare.” Over the next week, Borland, High Command and his advisers sketched out the skeletal framework of what would become Operation Nemesis.\r\n\r\nMilitary Intelligence had identified a Tevarin shipyard on the surface of Idris IV that served as the main repair facility and launching point for a majority of the Tevarin fighters in the system, as well as the operational hub for several unknown Tevarin structures that they were building around the globe. Nemesis intended to seize and occupy this territory to act as a forward operating position to gain a foothold back into Idris.\r\n\r\nThe UPE Military’s Research & Development Department had accelerated production on their new R27HE “Hull-Shredder” torpedoes, and by September 17 had them combat-ready for the mission. Naval forces assembled by the Ferron jump point while Army and Marine ground units trained relentlessly using (then untested) planetary invasion techniques.\r\n\r\nOperation Nemesis was a daring and divisive plan. Upon entry into Idris, the initial invasion wave of carriers, destroyers, corvettes and transports were to ignore all Tevarin cap-ships and push into the system, attempting to drag the Tevarin into a fight above Idris IV. Specified ships would break off along the way to form a defensive line between the target and the Ferron jump point. Army and Marine ships would invade the planet surface, seize military control points and hold until a steady stream of reinforcements could enter the system to back up the defensive line and reconnect to the initial wave who were in orbit besieging the planet.\r\n\r\nThe Operation officially launched at 2544-09-30_13:45 SET. Enemy contact occurred immediately after entering Idris. Customized missile ships entered the jump point first, launching a full spread of rockets before the rest of the fleet arrived. The initial wave commenced its push towards Idris IV. The Tevarin capital ships tried to intercept and engage the UPE Navy but the fleet maintained course and speed toward Idris IV.\r\n\r\nFinally, once the Army and Marines deployed to the planet, the Navy turned to fight. The battle above Idris IV began in earnest as fighters swarmed up from the surface. Three transports were lost during descent before the fighting spilled over onto the ground.\r\n\r\nThe 112th Infantry Battalion (Army) under Colonel Tio Koshi assaulted the shipyard (designated ‘the Hill’) along with Alpha, Bravo and Charlie Mechanized Companies on loan from the 3rd Expeditionary Unit as support. After six hours of combat, the 112th and the Marines took the Hill. For the moment, it seemed like the operation was going to be a resounding success.\r\n\r\nThen the moment passed.\r\n\r\nThe Tevarin unleashed a devastating strike against the fleet in orbit above Idris IV. The structures that the Tevarin were building turned out to be a prototype planetary defense system. Two carriers were annihilated in seconds. The remaining UPE ships scattered to avoid the fire from the planet. Even worse, the new Hull-shredder torpedoes began to fail, either exploding in their tubes or failing to arm when fired.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the Tevarin forces that had abandoned the Hill returned with renewed vigor.\r\n\r\nHearing reports from the ships, the 112th realized that they were going to be on their own very soon. Their mechanized escort was already down fifty percent of their original numbers. The soldiers were nowhere near as familiar with the Tevarin installation as their enemies and were having difficulty securing it.\r\n\r\nThe next planetary rotation would last a lifetime. The Naval vessels battled wave after wave of Tevarin fighters above Idris IV, refusing to give an inch, knowing that any space lost would certainly consign the troops below to a death sentence. The 112th suffered a devastating loss when a Tevarin fighter strafed the compound, dropping an anti-matter bomb that destroyed Colonel Koshi and his command staff. The ground forces became scattered, demoralized and the Tevarin seemed to pick up on it.\r\n\r\nThe last remnants of 3rd EU Bravo Company died in the push. The remaining Marines and the 112th fell back to their inner defensive position. Major Michael Colorry of the 112th Bat. Charlie Company was trying to orchestrate an extraction plan when an unseen sniper’s bullet took his life. His second-in-command, a young, ambitious officer Captain Ivar Messer, then assumed command of the company.\r\n\r\nMesser began calling danger-close bombing runs from the fleet’s Retaliator bombers while he organized ambush points with the surviving soldiers. For hours, the bombers dumped payload after payload of high-explosive ordinance on the converging Tevarin forces. Messer didn’t stop there, also organizing a small recon force to destroy the planetary defense system that was still devastating the fleet above. The group commandeered a downed Tevarin skiff and slipped past the lines.\r\n\r\nThe infiltration team, led by Sergeant Adam Corr, managed to not only discover the nexus of the planetary defense system but overtake and assume control of it. They turned the devastating weapon against the massing Tevarin fleet, long enough for UPE Naval reinforcements to enter the system.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Idris IV had taken another turn. Over the next few hours, the Tevarin forces began to fall back. Unfortunately, Corr and his team had to abandon and detonate the defense system before reinforcements arrived.\r\n\r\nAs the smoke cleared on Idris IV, over a hundred capital ships, thousands of fighters, and seventy-thousand lives had been lost on both sides. Messer and his forces still held the Hill. His actions had decisively turned the tide of the battle. The victory at Idris IV would galvanize the populace in the UPE, drive recruitment rates up, and build on the momentum to push further into the Tevarin systems.\r\n\r\nAt the center of all of this, the young ambitious Captain Ivar Messer, whose taste of power would begin to push him on a path that would change the course of Human history in a very different way.\r\n\r\nEND FEED",

As such, the system has no native population or representation in the UEE senate; it is officially governed by a panel of Imperial researchers.\r\n\r\nKalis IV, survey number DXP-55.7c, has attracted particular attention because of its believed similarity to Earth at this stage of a star system’s formation. Survey teams are observing the planet from orbital stations and spy-eye recon drones twenty-three hours a day and the work is less than thrilling. The potential for studying how an Earth-like planet is formed is exciting, but all parties involved know that it will take tens of thousands of years to gather the necessary data. Black market traders might be advised that the crews manning these posts will be looking for other forms of entertainment to fill their days.\r\n\r\nKallis’ 7th planet, a gas giant, has been identified as a potential refueling station, although only a small Lagrange platform currently exists there.

Flo-pets, the focus of a brief exotic animal fad among Earth’s upper class, were initially illegally trapped here.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the outer planet in the system is the infamous QuarterDeck PrisonWorld, a maximum security penal facility home to hundreds of thousands of hardened criminals. The UEE allows prisoners at QuarterDeck to work their sentences in a full-process antimatter refinery; the fuel is thus available cheaply and raw materials involved in its creation are sometimes at a premium. Bounty Hunters should note that QuarterDeck’s booking officers are known to pay a reasonable rate for captured criminals.\r\n\r\nD&E dictums specify that the system is not to be tampered with and so the other planets have also been declared off-limits for mining and exploration purposes. The small army of police and guards that monitor QuarterDeck ensure that no one interferes with the planets or the species on Kellog II.

        "article": "## Galactic Guide: Kilian System\r\n\r\n![Kilian concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/pp4fro1vkic1qr/post/Kilian_1.png)\r\n\r\n**Kilian** is where young soldiers go to learn the art of warfare and where old soldiers return to fade away. For them and most other Humans, it is the shining symbol of UEE military might. Located at the heart of the Empire, a single jump line away from Terra, and home to hundreds of military barracks, training facilities, shipyards and support facilities. Kilian’s economy is based entirely on the massive military presence, with weapons manufacturers and ship designers flocking to the system to offer their wares. Between the shipyards at Naval Station MacArthur to the Marine headquarters on Corin, Kilian may be the safest place in the galaxy . . . if you’re on the right side of the law.\r\n\r\nKilian itself is a white A-type main sequence star orbited by fourteen planets. The discovery of Kilian occurred early in man’s expansion into the galaxy. Terraforming of green-band planets began very early, as did the garrisoning of military forces here. While there was no specific plan to build out the system specifically as a military base, it naturally evolved from a forward base in the early days of exploration to the most important headquarters in the galaxy, as power shifted towards the region of space surrounding Terra. Only the UEE Army continues to maintain their formal headquarters on Earth; the Navy and Marine top commanders now direct troop and ship movements from armored city-bases on planets in the Kilian System. As a collateral development, Kilian has generated a large civilian population and is fully represented in the UEE Senate.\r\n\r\n### The Three Sisters\r\n\r\nThe first three planets in Kilian are dwarf worlds known informally as the Three Sisters. The sisters travel close to the star and are essentially uninhabitable rocks. Limited metallurgical resources are mined on the smallest of the sisters, Kilian III. For the most part, the worldlets are an outlet for UEE weapons testing exercises: their surfaces bear the scars of hundreds of years of antimatter blasts and railgun impacts.\r\n\r\n### Magma\r\n\r\nKilian IV is the system’s primary mining outpost. As the name — chosen by a particularly uninventive explorer — indicates, Kilian is covered in superheated metals and features heavy volcanic activity. No land area on Magma is stable, so miners operate flying carryalls capable of jetting entire massive refinery complexes from place to place.\r\n\r\n### MacArthur\r\n\r\nHome of UEE Navy headquarters and birthplace of the Bengal-class strike carrier! MacArthur (named after a famed army general of the previous millenium, in what naval personnel choose to find amusing irony) is home to the largest Human naval base in the galaxy. It’s where tens of thousands of naval aviators train every year and where all major naval exercises are planned and coordinated. The planet is orbited by countless rings of spatial moorings and drydock facilities. The largest ships in the known universe, including the Bengal, are constructed in the space around MacArthur.As a result, MacArthur is a place where merchants can make a killing. On the legal side, merchants can bring in processed ores, weapons components, shield generators and a myriad of other elements needed for constructing large warships. Those affiliated with the black market can also get rich on MacArthur, as the planet’s population of lonely ship crews has a variety of appetites. The latter category should be warned, though, that there are more standing military patrols in the Kilian system than there are anywhere this side of the Vanduul line.\r\n\r\n### Osha\r\n\r\nOsha is a small terraformed world, home to many of the families and support personnel for the system’s military population. It’s a temperate world that has been highly constructed: arcologies now dot the surface, providing homes for hundreds of thousands of husbands, wives and children of military personnel who are either assigned elsewhere in the system or deployed to distant stars. There is some profit to be made shipping to Osha, whose population generally seeks luxuries from the rest of Human-settled space.\r\n\r\n### Keene\r\n\r\nSlightly larger than Osha, Keene is another civilian world. Unlike Osha, Keene is the domain of military-aligned corporations and businesses. If a manufacturer has a military contract, you can bet it has a home office located somewhere on Keene. Manufacturers compete for factory slots on the world because an in-system factory allows one to be a much more efficient supplier. This means that regardless of resources, everything from toilet paper to starship bulkheads is manufactured here. Roberts Space Industries and Anvil Aerospace both maintain formal showrooms on Keene which may be visited by civilians.\r\n\r\n### Kilian VIII\r\n\r\nKilian VIII is an ocean world with an open secret: it is highly toxic to the point of total inhospitability. What appears from orbit to be a tropical paradise is in fact an orb of high-density fluid consisting of water, ammonia and more volatile liquids. No current space suit technology is capable of protecting a Human on VIII’s surface and even most starship hulls will dissolve with minimal contact.\r\n\r\n### Corin\r\n\r\nHome of the UEE Marines, Corin is a deadly ice world that is used for Marine command, housing and training. Dotted with icy tundras and craggy rock caves, Corin is technically outside the system’s green band. The Marines maintain a massive underground base, but also require that all trainees survive a six-month boot camp on the planet’s surface. Marine units not in the field are engaged in constant wargames here. Corin is one of the best-protected worlds in the galaxy, with a Marine carrier preventing unauthorized access at all times. The best advice: do not approach.\r\n\r\n### Outer Planets\r\n\r\nKilian X through Kilian XIV are uninhabitable. X has a thin atmosphere and a dense mineral-rich surface. Metal rights to the planet are currently locked in an ongoing court battle, so only claim hoppers need apply . . . and the massive military in the region makes that an unappealing prospect for all but the boldest miners. Kilian XI is a gas giant which is used primarily for in-system fuel supply. Automated harvester platforms surround the planet, gathering resources for UEE shipyards. Kilian XII, XIII and XIV are small, essentially dead worlds of little interest. Kilian XIII, sometimes called a “haunted planet,” does feature an impressive smoky-quartz surface that looks like nothing else in the galaxy.",

In truth, the phrase better describes Magnus a century ago; recent decades have seen increasing settlement and overall civilization in a system that considers itself the unofficial capital of Human frontier culture.\r\n\r\nFirst discovered in 2499, Magnus was a small, entirely undistinguished system: three planets orbiting a type K main sequence star. Dimmer than Earth’s own sun, Magnus did not have the pull to generate a system of outer planets or an extensive network of jump point tie-ins. Surveys have located no protoplanets, gas pockets or asteroid fields in the system’s environs; the area surrounding Magnus is the deepest, most desolate space imaginable. A single world, Magnus II, was identified as ideal for terraforming.\r\n\r\nThat process happened quickly. Magnus’ distance from well-traveled space plus the availability of heavy metals and the anticipated ease of terraforming Magnus II resulted in a military-commissioned closed-terraforming starting in 2533. By the late 26th century, Magnus had become a large-scale naval base and the source of a great deal of ship construction. This lasted approximately fifty years, until budget cutbacks and the desire to focus operations in other systems, like Kilian, lead to the large scale abandonment of Magnus.\r\n\r\nFor a time, Magnus II was a barren desert world — the effects of terraforming had not yet completely transformed the planet, and a ten-year period of extreme solar flares hampered its transition to a temperate world, increasing the decay of the UEE facilities and generally reducing overall interest in resettling Magnus. The result was an eerie, depopulated ghost world with declining structures full of refining and shipbuilding equipment considered too expensive to move elsewhere. During this period, the system’s population declined to less than 3,000, most of whom had no legal right to their encampments.\r\n\r\nIn 2751, the original military classification for the Magnus system expired and other colonists were technically allowed to move in. Seeing no practical use for the system, the UEE opted not to renew their lease claims for the sole inhabitable planet’s landmasses. The age of single-state colonization having long since ended, Magnus’ colonials were a ragtag group of outbackers, claim jumpers and an assortment of similar, less-savory types trying to escape their reputations on the core worlds. The result was a system with a reputation for a wild, anything-goes atmosphere, where Humans could live along the margins of the law. A culture supporting this system has since arisen organically, with a ‘kill-or-be-killed’ attitude that has developed into a strictly held frontier-style code of honor.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Magnus II, Borea, has become more civilized, increasingly playing its reputation and fading ghost towns for tourist dollars. It’s still among the more dangerous Human-settled worlds: while the government has come to adhere to a more formal system, assassinations are still not uncommon. This culture is not onesided, however: for all the lawlessness, Magnus is seen as a place where anyone can start anew, a system that strongly believes in ignoring an individual’s past in favor of his or her potential. For this reason alone, settlement on Borea is increasing, year by year.\r\n\r\n## Magnus I\r\n\r\nMagnus I is a chthonian planet, a former gas giant which has had its atmosphere fully separated by its proximity to the star’s sun. The result is a tightly compacted mass of rock rich in high value minerals. The UEE maintains full mining rights over Magnus I, and does not generally contract with outsiders for shipping or refinement. Owing to its cosmology, Magnus I is also a source of high grade diamonds, used both as gemstones and in factory operations. Again, the UEE moderates all sales and criminal elements have never established a significant foothold on Magnus I.\r\n\r\n## Magnus II (Borea)\r\n\r\nBorea is the terraformed center of the system. Classified as a near-Earth planet, Borea has a variety of climates and is generally ideal for Human settlement. The planet is dotted with dozens of centuries-old abandoned UEE naval facilities which are slowly fading into overgrowth.\r\n\r\nSome have been settled by frontiersmen, while other prefab cities have sprung up elsewhere unrelated to the original settlement. Subsistence farms cover the planet’s temperate zones, most run by loners who have traveled to Magnus to escape contact with the rest of the Human race. The general feeling is of a world unnaturally stuck between then and now.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the world is Newcastle. A recent spacebased assassination attempt on the whole of the planet’s Governor’s Council has caused the government to redirect all in-bound traffic towards the industrial city of Odyssa, which can now be considered Magnus’ only starport. Odyssa, formerly a shipbuilding city before the UEE’s abandonment of Magnus, has been revitalized in recent years with the development of Drake Interplanetary. Vast tracts of empty warehouses and rusting construction yards have been modernized and returned to life building Cutlasses and Caterpillars. Gangs are a serious problem in the city, and squatters have claimed the rights to many former UEE facilities; the result is an interesting place to hunt for questionably legal ship repairs and upgrades.\r\n\r\n## Magnus III\r\n\r\nMagnus III is a super Jupiter gas giant, a huge multi-colored sphere hanging at an extreme distance from Magnus’ sun. As it is not especially near any of the system’s jump points, Magnus III remains largely untapped as a refueling point. Persistent rumors claim that Magnus III’s LaGrange points are common meeting places for pirates, although this has never been confirmed. The lack of extraplanetary legal forces (and general cultural disinterest in punishing such crimes in the region) lend such rumors a significant air of believability. At the same time, Magnus III would be a notably out-of-the-way locale for anyone, especially the more significant pirate cartels.\r\n",

Due to the variable nature of the star, attempts to terraform have not been successful, so the system was simply abandoned. To the public (and most law enforcement) there is nothing of interest in the system.  To a sliver of the criminal element, it’s the site of a slave market, set up for randomly determined times and locations to keep it under the radar.\r\n\r\n>This guide can not, in good conscious, advise pilots to engage in human trafficking. Even with a less human set of morals, it would be ill-advised: modern slavers are just as likely to take a hapless cargo pilot right alongside his victims. The only advice is: avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\n## Observist Dark: Olympus, Ashana, Nul\r\n\r\nGreetings, traveler, there are millions of sights to see in the universe. While the team at THE OBSERVIST is here to make sure you get the best traveling experience possible, the true traveler goes beyond the safe and secure into the wild and unpredictable edges of the universe. This is OBSERVIST DARK, where we chronicle the systems where safety is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nNul System came from very inauspicious beginnings. Discovered in 2290, the popular story says that when the NavJumper Antoine Lebec (a resident of an Old Earth country called France) returned from the new system the first time, he was met by a group of fellow explorers. They asked if he found anything on the other side. He looked at them and said “Nul” and moved on. That might not have been entirely true. A Classic Cepheid supergiant resided on the other side, along with a handful of planets, none of which could be terraformed. For centuries, the system was empty, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t inhabitants, or, more importantly, places to visit.\r\n\r\n##ASHANA\r\n\r\nThe fifth planet, known locally as Ashana, is a gritty, unforgiving place that mirrors its inhabitants. Though it’s generally portrayed as a planet-wide desert, Ashana does have more variety in its biomes than the Vids give it credit, as seen in the mountain ranges in the north and frozen tundra in the south. Since the atmosphere is toxic to Humans and landing options are limited to the large desert, it’s easy to get confused. The other deceptive element of Ashana is its gravity. As in, it’s high, like dangerously high. It was this little planetary attribute that led to the inadvertent formation of the planet’s prime landing zone.\r\n\r\n###INTRODUCING OLYMPUS\r\n\r\nIn 2571, the UEES Olympus entered the Nul System, attempting to subjugate a growing refugee and criminal element of both Human and Tevarin that had been fleeing since Messer ascended to Imperator. The ragtag group of ships was no match for a fully armed carrier, but they were saved by one thing: arrogance. The Rear Admiral stationed aboard the Olympus was desperate to turn this simple sweep-and-clear operation into a boost for his career and ordered the carrier to personally pursue the refugees. When the carrier came within the reach of Ashana, the planet claimed its prize.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the massive carrier on the surface presumably killed everyone on board. It was only a matter of time before the same Tevarin refugees moved into the wreckage and rebuilt the systems to make it habitable.\r\n\r\nOnce you hit the landing deck of the old carrier, you will meet two characters that couldn’t be more different. Well, you’ll definitely meet one. A young Tevarin mechanic named Elo generally rushes out to see what ships are inbound. He runs a small shop called RAPID DESTABILIZATION, where he spends his days tinkering and repairing.\r\n\r\nThe wild card is KOD, who runs a shop in the old engineering section of the ship if he’s not too whacked out of his mind on WiDoW or homemade booze. If you can find him, he’s the guy to go to for fuel.\r\n\r\nIf you’re here to trade, GEN STORE is your spot. It’s the conduit for anything coming in or leaving Olympus. Weapons merchants, both buyers and sellers, can go to THE ARMORY, but that seems pretty self-explanatory, right?\r\n\r\nIf you need a drink, the Olympus’ old bridge has been converted into a bar called DARK SUN; just be careful not to be hypnotized by the dunes outside the windows. Or that effect might be triggered by something in the drinks. You never know.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing you should know if you’re thinking about visiting Olympus is the power structure. A Tevarin named NESCUS runs Olympus and generally wanders its halls if he’s not attending to business. If (more likely, when) you meet him, you will probably find him to be an amenable, pleasant person. Do not ever give him cause to dislike you. Nescus used to be a hitter for a syndicate known as the Coriolus Initiative. Though the rumor is that he amicably severed his ties with that organization, you have to wonder if you can ever really leave them behind. In short, he is well schooled in dishing out pain and death. Never put yourself in a position to receive a lesson.\r\n\r\nSounds crazy and dangerous, I know, but what’s wrong with living a little dangerously time-to-time, right? At the end of the day, while it’s nice to hear about it, you really should observe it for yourself.",

A scant fifty millennia ago, a brief flicker in geological time, the system was home to multiple vibrant ecosystems similar to Earth or Terra. That all changed abruptly when Odin’s star collapsed into a white dwarf. The immediate trauma completely enveloped the system’s first planet and quickly boiled off the biospheres of the others, killing all native life. When Earth’s first explorers jumped to Odin, they found a system of icy rock worlds with uniformly foreboding exteriors.\r\n\r\nThe immediate thought was that the system could become a mining hub, but its lack of jump transit points and some unique stellar features quickly made it clear that such operations were infeasible. Thus, lacking a strategic position or a terraformable world, Odin was relegated to the saddest fate for a star system: weapons testing area. By the early 27th century, the demonic crags of Odin’s core worlds were quickly being flattened by experimental weaponry intended for sale to the UEE military.\r\n\r\nOdin most recently became a cause celebre of the scientific community when a group of noted geobiologists came forward to point out that the government was allowing companies like Behring to wipe clean an otherwise well preserved fossil record that could tell the story of the life that came to evolve in the Odin system. While a grassroots “SAVE THE FOSSILS” movement initially gained some traction in popular culture, interest soon faded.\r\nThe Belt (~Odin I)\r\n\r\nThe Odin I Asteroid Field, commonly called the Belt, is possibly the most interesting area of the system. The remnants of the system’s pre-catastrophe first planet, the Belt is a seemingly unending field of minerals. Ore located in the Belt runs the gamut from basic slough to valuable heavy metals, with extremely valuable (and distinctive) caches of gemstones being discovered more often than one would expect. The UEE formally bans mining in the Odin system, but garrisons no forces there and generally takes a blind eye to the practice. There are, however, bigger dangers to mining operations seeking to skirt the law and take advantage of the former world’s riches. The first is an electromagnetic phenomenon called arch charges.\r\n\r\nThe result of the exposed planetary core’s iron-rich content coming into contact with cast-off stellar remnants, arc charges are deadly to any ship unlucky enough to be caught in their embrace. So many have been destroyed over time that legitimate mining operations have given up entirely on petitioning the Senate for licenses to exploit the Odin system. Heavily shielded independent ships may fare better, but the best advice is to stay away.\r\n\r\nAnd if the arc charges don’t get you, the pirates may. A warren of well-armed pirates, seemingly immune to the electromagnetic phenomenon, is believed to be based deep within the Belt. This group, whose organization and formal allegiance are unknown, has been involved in dozens of hit-and-run strikes against legitimate operations within a jump or two of Odin. The sum total of their effect on the countless black market gun runners and mining operations that attempt to wring a quick UEC out of the Belt is unknown.\r\nOdin II (and Vili)\r\n\r\nOdin II is ostensibly within the star’s green band, although the planet has only what little atmosphere it has naturally gathered in the last 50,000 years. Officially a UEE military operations base, Odin II is home to the occasional temporary “deep freeze” expedition. Scientists and military forces training for trans-polar combat operations pass through the world, but no one lives here permanently. Most of the surface of the planet has been curtained off for weapons testing operations, with robotic survey labs belonging to A&R, Behring and others dotting the equatorial planes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the planet’s moon, Vili, is the most famous corporate weapons testing range in the system (and possibly the galaxy). Much of the surface is exclusively owned by Behring’s shadowy Applied Technology division, and a notable percent of munitions expended by man in the past decade have been launched against lifeless rock formations and artificially deposited synthe-peeps on Vili. BAT research laboratories are located deep beneath the surface of the moon, away from all varieties of prying eyes. Testing ranges and a variety of supporting factories (antimatter refineries, chemical compulsion units and the like) surround the few Human-occupied locations on the moon.\r\n\r\nThe one part of the moon, and indeed the star system at large, open to travelers is Raleigh Station, a snowy space base erected by the UEE to allow the government (and civilian contractors) to bring in supplies and to ferry out weapons projects after their test cycles. Raleigh Station is not the most welcoming place in the galaxy, but there is enough to keep a traveler busy. Standard bulk food and medical supplies are always in demand here, and pilots have reported finding occasional deals on discarded military-grade surplus.\r\nOdin III & IV\r\n\r\nThe second planet in the Odin system, Odin III (natives are notoriously insistent that the Belt still be considered the first planet, to the point of influencing official star charts) is another insignificant, dead world. Although weapons testing is officially forbidden here, the surface of the planet has still been burnt to a cinder and irradiated beyond recognition. A famous photograph of the planet taken from orbit and used during the abandoned ecological campaign shows a massive, glowing delta-shaped blast impact cutting directly into the surface. Military sources formally deny that a weapon capable of causing such damage to a planet’s crust exists.\r\n\r\nOdin IV is a gas giant and home to a UEE-sponsored hydrogen rendering station and fuel depot in geosynchronous orbit. While the station is crewed, the facilities for interacting with outsiders are wholly automated: a supplier drops off unrefined hydrogen and takes on fuel without ever encountering any of the occupants. Starship crews are actively discouraged from layovers on Odin IV, although the station has a limited number of poorly maintained rental habit-cubes. Fuel prices are notoriously inexpensive for this region of the galaxy, and it is sometimes even worthwhile to make the jump to Odin to refuel a larger ship.",

To this day it remains the single farthest human world ever colonized. Earth’s most distant colony evolved peacefully for six years… until the first attack.\r\n\r\nArmitage was, it would later be established, an occasional Vanduul feeding world. Passing clans had marked the planet as a source of fresh livestock and would occasionally return for slaughter. The violent first contact incident occured in the system and it was followed almost immediately by raids against the colony. It isn’t clear whether the Vanduul were angered by the human presence in “their” system or if they were simply eager for new victims… but raids began immediately and only increased in frequency and ferocity. Within six months, Orion had been raided fifteen times; casualties among the colonists were atrocious.\r\n\r\nThe UEE was faced with a difficult decision: deploying the Navy to such a distant star would have been difficult and expensive without an established supply chain. Ultimately, Orion was abandoned as a formal human colony, with refugees abandoning their homes and possessions for a long transport ride back to the Empire.\r\n\r\nToday, Orion III is a destroyed world. Shattered human settlements and the remains of occasional Vanduul encampments remain on the surface, but it has been largely depopulated and defoliated. The planet’s surface, once largely inhabitable plains, is now pockmarked with impact craters and antimatter bombardment scorching.\r\n\r\nThere are few reasons to visit Orion today; the system is still in the distant reaches of space and offers no export… thrill seekers and anyone hoping to test their mettle against the Vanduul only.",

        "article": "![Pyro concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/16boo55ggsr1xr/post_section_header/Pyro.png)\r\n\r\n> “Yo ho ho, there’s a place I know,\r\n\r\n> The slam’s all clean and the wenches glow,\r\n\r\n> Yo ho ho, a-Ruin I’ll go,\r\n\r\n> Mark my jump off to Pyro.”\r\n\r\n> – Traditional Space Shanty\r\n\r\n## Galactic Guide: Pyro\r\n\r\nIf Spider is the face of piracy in the galaxy, Pyro is unquestionably the beating heart. An otherwise desolate, lifeless star system crippled by a prolonged nova phase, Pyro is most notably the home of the shared pirate outpost of RuinStation. Like Spider, Pyro is a case of pirates filling (and expanding upon) a void left when the system was abandoned by civilized developers; unlike Spider, Pyro’s station has not settled into an orderly system of black market commerce equivalent to that founded for proper traders on standard worlds. Here, opposing packs constantly struggle to own the station and all of the nearby action.\r\n\r\n### Background & Discovery\r\n\r\nAny prospect of developed life in the Pyro system vanished several million years ago, when the system’s star began to go nova. Astrobiologists who have examined the remains of its theoretical green-band planets have found little evidence that higher life forms would have been likely in the first place; nothing but algae-like fossils have ever been discovered. The system consists of six ruined worlds circling a bright, but ultimately dying, star. Were it not for the fact that jump points from two inhabitable systems have been discovered linking to Pyro, the system would likely never have been settled at all.\r\n\r\nThe system was ostensibly discovered in 2401 by the Roustabout, an Earth-flagged tanker ship moving through the Taranis System on the safe-route alternative to Kellar’s Run. The ship’s watch officer noted a gravitic anomaly thirty thousand kilometres off the transport’s port bow and left it at that. It was not for another forty-four years that the ship’s corporate owners, seeking new mining territories, dispatched an explorer to the region and formally charted Pyro and its environs. This survey simply noted the overall disarray of the planetary system, the difficulty of finding transportable resources and the unlikelihood of terraforming anything there successfully.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its development as a center of organized piracy, Pyro is also a household name in the UEE today because it served as the backdrop for one of Original Systems’ Arena Commander’s first levels. The icy blue nova and the frozen hellscape of planets slowly moving towards their destruction seemed an ideal location for Arena Commander’s designers to show off how interesting 3D space combat can be!\r\n\r\n### Pyro I\r\n\r\nPyro I is a charred black rock that is slowly discorporating into Pyro proper. There is little of interest here; the space around Pyro I is difficult to navigate with anything but the highest quality shields and no significant mineral deposits have been located on the planet’s surface to make ever landing here worthwhile.\r\n\r\n### Pyro II\r\n\r\nPyro II is a coreless planet that will, in time, also fall into the star. During the system’s initial discovery, Pyro II was a major focus: the planet held seemingly significant deposits of cadmium, titanium and gravity-forged gemstones. A minor “metal rush” saw human tradeships quickly deplete these deposits; within five years, for all practical purposes the world had become an empty husk.\r\n\r\n### Pyro III\r\n\r\nThe third planet in the system is the only one believed to have once existed in the green band, pre-nova; this is where tiny algae-like fossils have been discovered. For this reason, it was the initial focus of non-profit research efforts during Pyro’s initial exploration. Making life more difficult for researchers, the nova process has rendered Pyro III a largely magna world. With little left to discover, the scientific community quickly grew tired of Pyro III and the system in general. Pyro III is technically listed as a potential terraforming candidate by the UEE, although taming a magma world would be extremely difficult and no interest in this project has ever developed.\r\n\r\n### Pyro IV & V\r\n\r\nThe combination of Pyro IV, a rocky Mercury-like protoplanet, and Pyro V, a massive yellow and green gas giant, is one of the more striking stellar landscapes yet discovered in known space. Arguably a single entity now, Pyro IV and V are the result of a massive meteor strike which altered the orbit of the former into the latter. Pyro V now appears to be subsuming Pyro IV in slow motion, a visual difficult to top anywhere else in the galaxy. Pyro V is considered a low-quality refuelling point because of the poor hydrogen mix present in the upper atmosphere.\r\n\r\n### Pyro VI & Ruin Station\r\n\r\n![Gold Horizon Station](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/9kgxq8qv4w4tvr/post/GoldHorizonStation_03.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe outermost planet in the Pyro system, this subdwarf would be unremarkable if it were not the home of Ruin Station, populated by Pyro’s only permanent inhabitants. Though the station’s lineage was originally unclear (and is today often referred to as being secretive or conspiratorial), it is now known that it began life as a Gold Horizon terraforming base but was abandoned when it became clear that there was no reasonable terraformation to be had in Pyro or at nearby star systems.\r\n\r\nOnce the original settlers abandoned the prefab station, Pyro quickly fell into use as a meeting place for black market dealmaking. From there, it was only a matter of time until it followed the same path as Spider, with active pirate construction and the development of a unique subculture. However, where Spider’s culture centers around honor among thieves, Pyro is based more around the men with the most guns winning.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake: Ruin Station is the home of unrepentant pirates and no one else. It is not suitable for tourism, regular trade or even experienced bounty hunters seeking the thrill of combat. The pirates that do crew the station are the best of the best, constantly ready to stab each other in the back for a bigger piece of the action. Xeno Threat is the current pack in control of the station, although this can change at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\nGun combat on Ruin Station is so common that shop owners have actually installed a series of armored doors; when infighting erupts, local shops and facilities automatically seal themselves off. A highlight of Pyro’s dimly lit halls is Corner Four, a sequence of former research labs converted into drug factories and no-questions-asked medical treatment facilities. Neutrality, the station’s requisite dive bar, is the only arguably safe place on the station: armoured toughs called the Cousins keep the peace here, at least in so much as they are needed to protect the bar’s staff and facilities.\r\n\r\n**TRAVEL WARNING:** Any improperly shielded spacecraft will sustain residual damage from Pyro’s star while making transit through the system.",

        "article": "##Galactic Guide: Earth \r\n\r\n![NYC concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/722i0s9ojuf58r/post/Earthjp-Nyc.png)\r\n\r\nEarth: cradle of Humanity, heart of the Empire, birthplace of mankind … and a difficult place to turn a profit. It’s no secret that Earth is set in its ways. All roads lead to Earth and the system is designed to support native-born Humans above all others. Tax policies support Earth-based corporations at the extreme disadvantage of those based on worlds like Terra, while representation in the UEE Senate continues to skew disproportionately in favor of Earth’s populace.\r\n\r\nPut simply, Earth is the capital and namesake of the United Empire of Earth and it is the seat of power that governs everything from rising systems like Terra to distant colony worlds that barely impact the homeworlds’ economies. Home to the Imperator and the UEE Senate, Earth sets the standards for everything that happens in the Empire, from moderating economic models, to setting social trends, to organizing military campaigns. While other more strategically located star systems, like Terra, have begun to make claims for higher standing in the Empire, Earth is still the acknowledged center of the universe.\r\n\r\nContrarily, Earth wants for everything. Thousands of years of Human civilization have left many of the planet’s natural resources exhausted and the system imports trillions upon trillions of tons of food, raw metals, manufactured goods and everything else imaginable. If it were not for the so-called “balance tariffs” keeping prices noncompetitive, this would be an ideal situation for any erstwhile shipping magnate. As it is, a run to Earth can barely be guaranteed to provide more than a 5% profit … and that’s before you get to the exorbitant docking and refueling fees for spacecraft carrying other systems’ registration numbers.\r\n\r\nEarth is also safe, to an extreme. The UEE military, Advocacy and various police arms patrol the system ceaselessly and they are notoriously uncompromising when it comes to punishing wrongdoers in the system. There is no faster way to get an extremely high bounty on your head than to commit a crime, even a minor infraction, in space near Earth. The military dockyards in Earth orbit are home port to no less than five Bengal-class carriers and at least one is dry-docked at any given time.\r\n\r\nThe planet itself is pockmarked with star-ports, a natural evolution of nearly a millennium of Human space travel. Three of these have taken the throne as the significant import/export centers of the world: New York in North America, Moscow in Europe and Shanghai in Asia.\r\n\r\n###New York\r\n\r\n![New York concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/ck1wd81pojfper/post/NYC_refined.jpg)\r\n\r\nNew York is the cultural capital of the UEE, an intergalactic taste-maker and a celebrated blending of both old-style architecture and ultra-modern arcology construction. Most visitors immediately take note of the historical landmarks protected by a thick layer of domed visicrete, allowing such institutions as the Empire State Building and Central Park to continue to exist a midst a modern landscape of massive super-towers.\r\n\r\nIn terms of commodities, selling bulk goods in New York is like trying to get blood from a stone. Nowhere is more protected by UEE law than this city, and anyone but the most desperate traders are advised not to bother. Even black market goods are extremely risky, as it is unquestionably the most well-policed area in known space. However, New Yorkers — even those who have never left the planet — still fancy themselves cosmopolitan men-of-the-galaxy. As such, there is an active market for cultural trinkets from distant stars. Trendy New York galleries happily display everything from Hadesian ice shoes to damaged Xi’an engine coils … a vivid example of one man’s trash being another’s treasure.\r\n\r\nNew York is also home to the famed Roberts Space Industries headquarters complex, featuring a showroom and museum. Many visitors make it a point to pay their respects upon arriving in the port, celebrating RSI’s involvement in introducing mankind to the stars.\r\n\r\nPossibly New York’s greatest importance is that it truly is the junction point of the universe in terms of trading. While Earth produces few valuable raw materials in this day and age, almost everything moves through its most significant port on its way somewhere in the UEE. If you’re on the prowl for a particularly rare upgrade or an extremely special commodity, the shopping district surrounding New York’s spaceport is the place to seek it.\r\n\r\n###Moscow\r\n\r\n![Moscow concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/ja4ms4m9urrsqr/post/Sol_moscow_refined_thumb.jpg)\r\n\r\nMoscow is a no-nonsense kind of town with more of an urban blue-collar vibe than New York. Moscow is a major distribution center for manufactured goods, in particular jump engines and thrusters produced in the factory complexes that span the Urals. Goods are moved into the city for dispersal to the stars through a system of high-speed transport trains. Down on their luck spacers can always find hard work in the Moscow dockyards, which account for the vast majority of Earth’s export shipping.\r\n\r\nDespite this, Moscow is not a manufacturing town and has little need for raw materials (which are sourced elsewhere). The city tends to have a taste for the opulent, and luxury goods sell as well as anything can on Earth. Traders are advised to ship high-end electronics, artwork, high quality foods and various non-offensive black market items to Moscow before trying to turn a profit running guns or metals.\r\n\r\n###Shanghai\r\n\r\n![Shanghai concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/7l2ahqzr7xh4vr/post/Aerialshot_beijing_refined2.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe largest star-port in Asia, Shanghai has retained more of a link to the surrounding environment than the vast cityscapes of Moscow or New York. Though still a bustling metropolis, Shanghai is your best chance for seeing a bit of foliage or natural water. Shanghai boasts rail and transit lines stretching to the nearby East China sea, a port region capable of water-docking some larger types of spacecraft. The Aegis China factory produces Idris-class corvettes and puts them through their pre-space trials in the area.\r\n\r\nShanghai has a need for raw materials, especially rarer extragalactic varieties. The less likely a material is to be found on Earth, the more valuable it will be on the commodities market in Shanghai; think Vanduul kan ores, thermacrete, isometal and the like. There is a bustling black market in the city, unlike any found in Earth’s other major ports: if you’re on the hunt for illegal cyborg upgrades, try Shanghai first.",

Boasting a wide green zone with four inhabitable super-earths, the system is, from a cosmological perspective, unusual. Strictly speaking, star systems as purely inhabitable as Stanton simply don’t exist. The combination of the proper star type with the evolution of four especially large Human-suitable biospheres requiring limited terraforming is so unlikely as to strongly suggest design. Meanwhile, the divergent ecologies on Stanton’s four worlds are of significant interest to scientists of all stripes.\r\n\r\nNo one is sure exactly who first settled the Stanton system. All indications are that it was discovered by a free agent trader and that word of the location and its potential riches spread slowly on the electronic grapevine. By the time the UEE noticed the system’s existence, all four planets had populations numbering in the tens of thousands. That notice spelled their doom. A quartet of super-earths are an extremely rare find and the Empire quickly declared Stanton to be a case of eminent domain, citing a need to protect and extend nearby jump lanes. Without formal colonization papers on file, the existing inhabitants had little choice: prospectors, survivalists and other squatters have little means to protect themselves from the might of a Bengal-class carrier.\r\n\r\n![Stanton concept art #4](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/ib9pwkshvpvi8r/post/Stantonpreviz4.png)\r\n\r\nThe Empire was then stymied. As is often the case, wanting was a great deal more interesting than having. With a down economy in the midst of a hundred-year colonization drought, the UEE had few options for actually exploiting Stanton. UEE naval engineers conducted the small amount of required terraforming, a series of underfunded military outposts were established, and then Stanton sat unwatched for another generation. The decision was ultimately made to sell the system piecemeal to the highest bidders. Mega-corporations were quietly contacted and asked to bid for their own planets. The winners are believed to have flushed trillions into the UEE economy: MicroTech, Hurston Dynamics, ArcCorp and Crusader Industries. In a remarkable lack of originality, the four worlds are now named MicroTech, Hurston, ArcCorp and Crusader.\r\nThe mega-corporations moved in slowly but surely, initially refusing to displace the existing inhabitants of the system (technically, they bought the land and not the people or anything already constructed there). Over the years, however, the system has become fully corporatized and the initial settlers have been (often literally) driven underground. The super-earths are now dotted with factories, corporate headquarters, testing ranges, mining facilities and other company facilities. Only those working for the corporations (or anyone leasing their space) come to live in the Stanton system, inhabiting orderly company towns.\r\n\r\nToday, Stanton is a great place to travel if you’re interested in the materials produced by several of the galaxy’s most successful corporations … or if you think you can make a profit shipping these companies the goods they need to keep working.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Stanton I: MicroTech\r\n\r\nStanton I, home to the MicroTech corporation, is a large and generally cold planet. The temperature is the result of an error during the UEE terraforming process, which lead to unusually dense cloud production. MicroTech produces MobiGlas here, a now-standard piece of digital assistive technology used by nearly anyone traveling off-world. Although MobiGlas has become ubiquitous, MicroTech specializes in all forms of electronics, including those found in ship systems. This world is a good place to start looking for advanced sensor technologies which could provide an edge while dogfighting. Space on the world is leased to smaller companies, including some of MicroTech’s competitors … probably because it allows the corporation to keep a close eye on them. Buyouts among successful Stanton I-based startups are common. Visitors are advised to seek work and cargo news at Wally’s Bar; just don’t ask for Wally.\r\n\r\n###Stanton II: Hurston\r\n\r\nStanton II is home to Hurston Dynamics, an aristocratic family-run weapons manufacturing concern which has bled the world dry. Stanton II’s ecosphere has been largely destroyed, with almost all indigenous life killed by the mining and manufacturing processes here. Hurston builds several lines of reliable weapons, and pilots looking for specialized guns might do well to visit here. The planet also produces a variety of munitions which are sold to other companies, and transport assistance is always well compensated. Workers are imported for year-long factory or mining contracts; few choose to re-up. Stanton is always in need of cheap labor and is a good source for traders looking to move antimatter precursors.\r\n\r\n###Stanton III: ArcCorp\r\n\r\nArcCorp, Stanton III, is the most visually impressive of the worlds today. While the other planets, even polluted Hurston Dynamics, retain some indication of their natural origins, ArcCorp is now an entirely constructed world. All of the terrain has been sculpted, zoned and built upon, leaving nothing for nature. ArcCorp builds fusion engines in bulk, using the underground resources on Stanton III to provide engines for hundreds of thousands of civilian spacecraft every year. Traders porting at ArcCorp are advised that in addition to deals on weapons, they can find just about anything else here. ArcCorp is absolutely indiscriminate about who they lease property to, and hundreds of other smaller companies have made their home near the world’s north polar region. Anthropologists familiar with the Xi’An have posited that ArcCorp is the closest human equivalent to a Xi’An factory world, and many have drawn the conclusion that our civilization will someday evolve along the same lines.\r\n\r\n###Stanton IV: Crusader\r\n\r\nStanton IV is Crusader, called “Cl” by the natives; it is an unusual world. Formed midway between a telluric world and a gas giant, Crusader’s small rocky core is enshrouded in an especially deep low-density atmosphere. Initial UEE terraforming efforts failed to allow unfettered habitation of the planet itself, but rendered the atmosphere breathable at high altitudes. The planet then became home to a military-constructed latticework of inhabitable floating platforms, since expanded exponentially to suit the needs of Crusader Industries. The situation is unusual, but ideal for Crusader, which makes large-scale commercial transport ships which would otherwise need to be built beyond the atmosphere. Being built in open air allows the cost of these ships to be reduced by almost 40% on the back end, which is often passed along to consumers. The company also provides quality housing for their employees — both in planetside domes and in habitats woven into the latticework — and the portion of the world available to visitors is usually considered the nicest port in the system. The shipyards themselves are eerily beautiful, with huge transport ships suspended in mid-atmosphere surrounded by a lighted webbing of Crusader facilities.\r\n\r\n##TRAVEL WARNING\r\n\r\n Visitors should note that while the standard United Empire of Earth penal code technically applies in the Stanton System, the UEE does not police the region. Private squadrons and hired mercenaries belonging to the inhabiting supercorporations enforce their own laws here. ",

        "article": "##Galactic Guide: Terra System\r\n\r\n![Terra concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/pu0ouaxhay8ler/post_section_header/Jp_terra1.png)\r\n\r\nTerra, shining jewel of the United Empire of Earth! Terra III, commonly referred to by its star’s name, has made great strides towards becoming the cultural focus of the Empire. While die-hard Earth loyalists would dispute such a claim, there is no doubt that Terra has its finger on the pulse of the civilized galaxy. From the increasing inflow of megacorporate HQs to the system to the influence of Terran originated music on popular culture, Terra is unquestionably the closest thing to a rival Earth has ever produced.\r\n\r\n###History\r\n\r\nThe Terra system, then designated 342A, was first charted in 2508 and explored as part of a five-system “long run” research expedition in 2516. When the first long-distance magnetic relay images of the system’s third planet resolved, the explorer crew immediately knew they had hit it big. A natural super-earth located squarely in the star’s green band, Terra III was immediately recognizable for it’s astounding similarity to an untouched Earth. Lush, verdant and brimming with natural resources, Terra’s colonization was immediately obvious. Within two years no fewer than seven colonial sloships had been dispatched to the world.\r\n\r\nAstrophysicists soon staked their own claim with a startling discovery: Terra system’s unique location and makeup meant that it was a strong jump point hub. Like Sol, Terra is a G-type main sequence star. Unlike Sol, its outer planetary system never formed. Without the mass diffusion caused by gas giants and with the star’s location in the centre of a dense stellar cluster, extremely stable jump points arose easily. Thus far, five jump points have been charted and scientists believe that a sixth is almost a certainty. (Theoretically, as many as twenty-four could exist, although the odds against most of them ever being stable enough for transit are astronomical.) Exobiologists, too, had an early interest in the system: massive stone ruins clearly indicative of intelligent life were discovered on Terra III’s southern continental mass. No other evidence of this ancient civilization has yet been uncovered on the planet, creating one of the most-debated archaeological mysteries of our time.\r\n\r\nTerra III was the twelfth planet colonized by the United Empire of Earth. In four centuries, owing to its jump network and location, it has evolved into a massive trade hub. Kiel, Baker, Kilian and other name systems are short hops from the star. The world’s plentiful resources, cultivated carefully so as not to impact the environment, have fueled the Empire’s Eastern Expansion Program.\r\n\r\n###Aero (Terra I)\r\n\r\nA nondescript rock world incredibly close to its star. Although rich in certain minerals, attempts to harness resources on Aero have been largely unsuccessful due to its proximity to the sun. Even the harshest environment suits are incapable of sustaining Human life long enough to conduct factory maintenance on a world with a 95 Standard Earth Day orbital period.\r\n\r\n###Pike (Terra II)\r\n\r\n![Concept art Terra II](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/txng30o2mxdbtr/post/Jp_terra2.png)\r\n\r\nThe mining efforts on Pike, on the other hand, are a masterpiece of Human engineering. One of the most mineral-rich planets in the galaxy, Pike is dotted with thousands of unmanned “cities” churning out tons of platinum, mercury, iron and gold every day. With three times the orbital period of Aero, Pike is still incapable of sustaining Human life for an extended duration. Regardless, the lack of atmospheric storms and other weather events means that fully mobile robot machinery can operate with peak efficiency and requires very little downtime. The mines and refineries of Pike have been essential to fuelling Terra’s expansion and to allowing Terra itself to remain relatively untouched.\r\n\r\n###Terra (Terra III)\r\n\r\nThe capital city of Terra is Prime, a beautiful bayside megacity built on the foundations of two of the original colony ships. A stark contrast to Earth’s metropolises, everything in Prime was planned by the original settlers, leading to a much greater balance between nature and civilization than is found elsewhere in the Empire. Unlike many cities, Prime’s primary landing zone is located away from the city to reduce pollution and air congestion. A monorail runs pilots to and from their hangars. Don’t let the relaxed atmosphere fool you, though: Prime has everything New York or Moscow does, from ship upgrade stores to black market opportunities. The city itself divides into two major regions: the sparkling Downtown and the lower class residential region known as The Block. Opportunities for visitors are available in both portions of the city.\r\n\r\nTerra’s second-largest city is Quasi, in the colder southern hemisphere. Quasi is built into the shadow of the massive ruins discovered early in Terra’s exploration. Quasi is considered more of a tourist destination than Prime, although several corporations operate in the region. Crusader Industries, best known for its facilities in Stanton system, operates the Platinum Bay landing facilities.\r\n\r\nNew Austin, another initial colonization point, is as close as Terra comes to an industrial city. New Austin is a business park writ large, home to corporations like ORIGIN Jumpworks and Cronus Devices. The cost of living in New Austin is lower, leading to more of a “blue collar” sensibility, but moneyed compared to other worlds. The centrepiece of the city is The Old Hall, a former Miner’s Guild meeting area now populated by factory owners, pilots, haulers and shippers.\r\n\r\n###Gen (Terra IV)\r\n\r\nOft overlooked is the fact that Terra’s sister world, Gen, is also an inhabited world. This smaller planetoid, the outermost in the system, was terraformed roughly a century after Terra’s initial settlement and is now home to the diplomatic and military aspects of the system’s government.\r\n\r\nConsisting largely of military bases, Imperial administration and housing, the world represents a conscious effort on the part of the Terran system planners to separate business and pleasure. There is an ongoing debate about Gen’s representation in the Senate. Though the planet is well-populated, the inhabitants are almost exclusively government workers. Thus far, Earth has shut down any attempts to award them representation, seeing it as a thinly veiled plot to extend Terra’s influence.",

        "article": "##Galactic Guide: Tiber\r\n\r\nThe star traveler’s guide to Tiber could best be summed up with a single word: don’t. Or rather, DON’T! The site of countless battles between man and monster, Tiber is a bleeding wound on the face of the explored galaxy that shows absolutely no sign of healing.\r\n\r\nTiber was first charted by UEE long-range explorers in 2474, at which time it was promptly filed away as an uninteresting star system. A standard K type main sequence star orbited by two small planets, Tiber bore no interesting resources, strategic jump lines or anything else that would make it appealing for terraformers or other developers.\r\n\r\nFollowing the UEE’s failure to hold Orion, its forces fell back to Caliban and Tiber. Given the obvious advantages of Caliban, most of these forces were stationed there rather than in Tiber. It should have come as no surprise that the Vanduul seized upon the all but undefended Tiber system as a base for raids further into Human territory. Vanduul tribes moved into the system and essentially established a permanent garrison.\r\n\r\n###Grinder\r\n\r\nWhen Tiber’s role in the then-shocking Vanduul assaults was discovered, the UEE dispatched its elite Sixth Battle Group on a cleansing mission. Armed with antimatter bombs, the fleet roasted the Vanduul encampments on Tiber II with impunity, leaving the surface a temporarily glowing mess. The response was immediate, overwhelming, and the most seemingly organized action that has ever been witnessed of the Vanduul: elite Vanduul carrier air wings, the best of the best, cut into the otherwise occupied UEE force and slaughtered them to the last man.\r\n\r\nOnly a single remote observer, stationed at the jump point to Garron, escaped to deliver word of the devastation. Thus was born Grinder, ground zero of a multi-generational war between mankind and the Vanduul. In the ensuing years, no fewer than nineteen major initiatives have been made to push the Vanduul out of Tiber.\r\n\r\nMassive fleet actions, attempts at global landings to hold Tiber II itself, and even “clean slate” operations designed to simply eliminate the ability of the system to sustain military occupation have all fallen flat. Millions have died in these attempts, and the ever-expanding fields of wreckage are now legendary. Countless civilians, seeing the deadly battlefield debris as potential for profit, have made the same leap with similar fatal results.\r\n\r\nToday, the battle continues unabated. In addition to regular reconnaissance sorties (and occasional reconnaissance-in-force missions) the system is frequented by thousands of private spacecraft commanders each year. Whether they are attempting to prove themselves by engaging a Scythe in fighter combat or trying to profit from the system’s resources, their fate is nearly always the same: left as grist for Grinder.\r\n\r\nThe only remotely “safe” time to visit Tiber is, surprisingly, during a major battle. With UEE supply chains around the galaxy stretched to the limit, the military is frequently interested in civilian support for combat operations. Support ships carrying medical supplies and other necessities will generally be well-protected, providing they stay away from the battlelines themselves. Of course, identifying where the battlelines hang can be problematic itself.\r\n\r\n###Tiber I\r\n\r\nTiber I is a small, dense planet close to Tiber’s sun. The planet’s CO2 -heavy atmosphere is breathable, but the extreme heat from the nearby sun would make life here an unpleasant proposition, even without the constant combat. Although extensive surveys have not been conducted, all available research indicates that there is nothing of value on Tiber I, and it is hard to imagine anything being worth the risk and expense of putting a Human there to learn more. Tiber I’s orbit is nestled just inside an extraordinarily heavy asteroid belt, which makes exploration even more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe asteroid belt is otherwise unremarkable, with low concentrations of valuable minerals. This belt is made up of smaller asteroids moving at high velocities, and is largely lacking in sizeable planetoids that could be converted into hidden bases (a fact of which UEE intelligence, eager to have a listening post closer to Tomb, is all too aware).\r\n\r\nUEE deep space photography stations have recorded an unusual movement of weather systems on the surface of Tiber I, which meteorologists believe would allow for periods of improved conditions once every four years.\r\n\r\nAverage clearance is roughly three days, during which the distance imaging seems to suggest the atmosphere itself becomes noticeably clearer, with CO2 concentrations settling around the planet’s nominal polar regions. With Vanduul hunter squadrons nearby, testing this hypothesis has proven a practical impossibility.\r\n\r\n###Tiber II (Tomb)\r\n\r\n![Grinder concept art](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/04wbtd1x6053fr/post/GRINDER.jpg)\r\n\r\nAn arid, desert world coated in nearly blood-red copper dust, Tomb represents more than anything else the unquenching maw of the Vanduul war machine. Much of the planet’s surface is coated with the wreckage of spacecraft and other former war machines. The remains of countless repelled UEE attacks, private attempts at profiting from the unusual system, and destroyed Vanduul technology layer the planet.\r\n\r\nTomb is not a permanent graveyard, however: the wreckage which accumulates there is in turn devoured by massive Vanduul harvesters. These mechanical beasts ingest all forms of matter and convert them for use by the Vanduul war machine. The harvesters found on Tiber have an even more terrifying dual purpose: they seem to be the source for the newer harvesters that have been dropped onto Human colonies during raids. These “mother harvesters,” visually no different from harvesters observed elsewhere, are, in effect, duplicating themselves to spread terror throughout the galaxy. Everything from starship wrecks to the bones of fallen soldiers ultimately feed the very enemy they were attempting to defeat.\r\n\r\nThe world is also home to countless Vanduul war-camps, Spartan temporary base camps used by the Vanduul forces constantly on the move through the system. While Humans would not find Tomb’s environment particularly welcoming, the Vanduul seem to thrive in the climate, and they pay little mind to the landscape of destroyed spacecraft around them. (The Vanduul have never been observed to have a particular interest in capturing technology.) Attempting to visit one of these camps would be suicide for a Human being, but declassified records from attempted Marine landings have provided a great deal of knowledge about their usual layout.\r\n\r\nWhile Tomb may seem an attractive target to hopeful salvage teams, be well warned that no one is known to have successfully landed on the planet to recover any of the priceless military hardware left there. Travelers are warned to avoid any such attempt. The UEE has never been able to establish a viable landing zone on Tomb, and unless you are part of an unlucky Marine detachment, you have little hope of even reaching the surface.",
